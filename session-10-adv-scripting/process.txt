ping 8.8.8.8  --> ping google DNS
ping 8.8.8.8 > output.log & --> run in the backgroound 
and take results in to file

ping 8.8.8.8 > output.log 2>&1 & 

redirects standard error (fd2) to standard output (fd1)
means any error outputs or regular logs both go into the same log file.

0 = standard input 
1 = standard output
2 = standard error

If you want to see the live logs
tail -f output.log 

To kill process find out process ID:
ps aux | grep ping

and then
kill process-id
