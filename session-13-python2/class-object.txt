class and object are the main pillers of OOPs 

class is the structure of your code, with the help of class 
we can create multiple objects. each object has its unique identity

to initalize objects (construct) we can use
__init__ method
self is used to make your local variables to access them inside the class.

so with each method you need to use self which is one parameter so using that
you can use class level variables like id,name,marks

to create object use class Name and pass values to its init method
you can use other methods of class by using object name 
dot operator and the method name
